Write a python program to store the numbers given by the user in an array, and then find the mean, deviation & variance.
Note: Mean =   mean = Total sum / n
Variation =\sigma={\sqrt {\frac {\sum(x_{i}-{\mu})^{2}}{N}}}
Deviation = sqrt(variance);

import math
numbers = [float(x) for x in input("Enter numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]
total_sum = sum(numbers)
n = len(numbers)
mean = total_sum / n
variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers) / n
deviation = math.sqrt(variance)
print("Mean:", mean)
print("Variance:", variance)
print("Deviation:", deviation)
