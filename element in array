2 Write a python program to search for an element in an array. Return the position of the user-given element if it is found in the array otherwise display that it is not found.

arr = [int(x) for x in input("Enter elements of the array separated by spaces: ").split()]
element = int(input("Enter the element to search for: "))
found = False
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if arr[i] == element:
        print("Element", element, "found at position", i)
        found = True
        break
if not found:
    print("Element", element, "not found in the array")
